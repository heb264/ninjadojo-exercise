# Notes on Take Home Exercise
1. took the printed PDF and created drew the  various sections and containers on it.
2. Next I took the pdf and uploaded to cssdrive.com/imagepalette generator to get a color palette to use. Added the colours.css file
3. Source a few images to put in the products section, used imagemin to 'squash' them to a smaller size. Ideally I would do an initial resize as well.
4. coded out the sections without CSS first, then read up on Bulma CSS and how to implement. Took note of what components and styles I would be using.
5. added in the styles from Bulma CSS via the cdn and created a ninjadojo.css file, as well as embedded and inline css as a first pass to change to the color palette.
